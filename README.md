A shiny app for looking at your spotify listening trends

Idealistically at some point I would like to be able to compare analysis of two or more users;

ex1: On Mondays Bob likes to listen to more math-rock than Alice and on Thursdays and Saturdays Alice listens to more math-rock than Bob

ex2: Bob, Alice, John, & Jane all like to listen to The White Stripes, but only John & Jane like to listen to Drake (with some kind of threshold based on your most listened to songs of a genre determining the strength of commonality)
